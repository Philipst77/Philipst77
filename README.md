## 🛠️ Featured Projects
- **Spatial-Semantic Mamba (SS-Mamba)**  
  Developed a novel **Mamba-based framework for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis** that preserves 2D spatial structure and semantic relationships. Introduced **2D State Space Models (2D-SSM)** with semantic patch ordering to address limitations of traditional MIL approaches.  
  **Results:** Achieved state-of-the-art performance on Camelyon16 (95.1% AUC), TCGA-BRCA (89.1% AUC), and BRACS (85.8% AUC).  
  📄 *Graduate-level research project (unpublished manuscript / preprint)*
  
- **Facial Recognition Project**  
  _Built a real time facial recognition - system using OpenCV and Deep Learning. Implemented face detection and recognition pipelines with efficient matching algorithms._

- **Linear Regression Project**  
  _Designed and trained a linear regression model from scratch to-predict trends based on real-world data. Focused on gradient descent optimization and loss minimization._

- **Neural Network Project**  
  _Built a custom neural network model-without using high-level frameworks. Implemented forward pass backpropagation, and trained on classification datasets, Including Cosine Similarity checking and Euclidean Distance._

- **SQL Database Manager**  
  _CLI tool built with Java and JDBC for library database management complete CRUD functionality, SQL queries  and database normalization up to 3NF._

- **AutoSeedBot**  
  _Autonomous ecofriendly robot designed for reforestation. Implemented sunlight detection for navigation and automated seed distribution using custom-coded 3D-printed hardware._
